## Improv

Welcome to the Kittn API! You can use our API to access Kittn API endpoints, which can get information on various cats, kittens, and breeds in our database.

_The Kittn API was well-meaningly copied from [Slate's wonderful API example](http://tripit.github.io/slate)_


## Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```sh
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

> Make sure to replace meowmeowmeow with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](#).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`


## Errors

The Kitten API uses the following error codes:
